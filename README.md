These are the source file projects for the Cave of Programming Spring Boot tutorial (see courses.caveofprogramming.com).

They represent steps along the way to creating a simple social network.

Although the associated video tutorials are not free, you're welcome to use this code, at your own risk, in whatever way you see fit. Attribution (to John Purcell) and links back to www.caveofprogramming.com are not necessary, but are of course greatly appreciated if you choose to add them.
